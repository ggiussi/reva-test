Yet, the same people boast proudly that they have educated Africa. It is difficult to see how they can have it both ways. If independent Africa is still without the benefits of modern education (as it is) then 75 years of colonial exploitation undoubtedly have something to do with that state of affairs; and the absurdity is so much the greater when one contemplates how much Africa produced in that period and how much of that went to develop all aspects of European capitalist society, including their educational institutions. Cecil Rhodes could afford to leave a legacy of lavish scholarships to white students for study at Oxford University, having made a fortune\nfrom exploiting Africa and Africans.","source":{"title":"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa","author":"Walter Rodney","year":[1972],"link":[{"$type":"link","id":"4ca45a70-a4c9-46fc-b862-2071af842cae","url":"http://abahlali.org/files/3295358-walter-rodney.pdf","title":"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa"}]}}]},{"name":"Kwame Ture","image":{"$type":"image","id":"5833e59f-2cb7-405c-90c6-a1e6f175119a","url":"http://www.aavw.org/images/speeches_carmichael.jpg"},"coor":{"lat":10.66,"long":-61.51},"description":"Carmichael was born on June 29, 1941, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.
